cd - change directory
mkdir - make directory
ls - list
touch - create a file
At Desktop
mkdir project
cd project
cd (home)
cd .. (back)
ls
touch file.txt (create a file)
cat file.txt (display whatever is there in file.txt)


want to write something in file.txt
vm file.txt
i to start writing
esc :q to exit 
esc :wq save and exit
3 insertion has been made -> 3 lines of code has been added

undo git init
rm -rf .git

I have this project folder now i want to maintain the 
history of this project using git.
The entire history(I create a new file, make changes, delete some file)
all history gets stored in .git(git-repositry(folder))
.file All are hidden
so for that initilaize a empty git repositry(folder)
After intialzing .git folder gets created in project folder
so all the changes we are going to make in the project
folder will be tracked by this .git folder i.e hidden

we can see this hidden folder by -> ls -a

Now we will be able to maintain the history of this project directory any change made in this project now git will pick it up

touch file.txt
 git status will show
 git status(these are the changes that are not currently in the history of this project)
 A file.txt has been added and it is currently untracked

 to unstage -> 
 changed something in file.txt now it is untracked 
 if i mistankely did git add .
 now file.txt is in staging area i want it to unstage for that
  git restore --staged file.txt
  git -rf file.txt (delete the file.txt)

If i mistakenly deleted some file it will be in the history of git we can seee it by git log
/*
Each commit has a hash id, each commit is built on each other so you can't delete a commit n betwwen 

whatever commit hashcode i copy all the commit above its will be removed

git reset hashcode

the commit above this hashcode will be removed
all the commits get removed are in the unstage area

git statsh->
created two txt file in project folder
add some text
did git add .
they are in staging area
made some changes in the txt file by adding some text 
but i dont want to loose this changes also dont want to commit this right now basically want to send them backstage and whenever i need them i will call them
for that i need to have one intial commit next time
before commiting i can do
git add .
git stash

if i do cat file.txt -> hello

if the people in the backstage are i dont want they comeback i have changed my mind i can do 
git stash clear
 now they will never come back

git stash pop -> all the people in the backstage come in the staging area
cat file.txt -> hello again


git remote add origin link
remote - working with urls
add - you are adding a url
origin - name of the url you are going to add

* branch
git branch newBranch 
git checkout newBranch

AFter checkout the * thing that was on main is now on newBranch
head is just a pointer that say all the commits you will 
made will be added on the head.
head the branch it is pointing to at that time.

now merge both the branch

git merge newBranch

* Make some changes to the project or contribute to
the existing project on github/gitlab

first fork it (make copy of it)
git clone url
from where you have forked this project forkedProjectUrl is known as upstreamUrl
git remote add upstream url
origin is my personal, upstream is from where i have forked it

Pull request
modified something in the exisitng code bas of cloned project
Now i want to commit that changes but i will not commit
in the main branch instead will create a new branch switch
to that brancha and commit in that branch

whatever code i have in mycode of newBranch
merge it with the main branch of original code

when you create a copy of someone project whatever changes
you make in your fork to get reflect in his project
you request via pull request(PR)
after making changes and commiting will push my newcode in
newBranch a compare&PullRequest will popup
now go to compare&PullRequest click and then create pull request
a notification will be sent to samar to merge
after he will aprrove my new code will gets merged.

Now if i make further changes and commit it it will not get
me the option to again raise a new pr
the commit will be show in the existing pr as a commit
one branch can only open one pull request

if i want to remove a commit from the existing pull request
git log 
hashcode pick that
git reset hashcode

i have made changes in my fork code in newBranch and
merged my newBranch with same branch lets say 2 commit

but my forked code main branch is behind 2 commit from my
newBranch

*****Squash commit in one single commit
 created a file 
 touch 1
 git add .; git commit -m "1"
 touch 2
 git add .; git commit -m "2"

i want to merge all this commit in one single commit


***Merge conflict
you changed in a file on line number 3 and someone else
also made change in line number 3.
Git will get confused should i take your changes or that
person changes

4-> 
git log
git fetch --all --prune (fetched all the changes)
git checkout main
git reset --hard upstream/main reset my main branch of the origin to the main branch of upstream
git log
git push origin main (to update newBranch to main branch i.e same level sync)


 1->
 mkdir project
 cd project
 git init
touch file.txt
git status
git add .
git commit -m "my-first-commit"
git log

2-> Push to github from git bash
cd workattech
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial-commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/himanshurhlk57/Data-Structures-Algorithms.git
git remote -v
git branch -M main
git push origin main / git push origin main --force

if i made some change in the local directory and want that it should reflected on github too
git add .
git status
git branch 
git push origin main

3->
makeChanges
git branch newBranch
git checkout newBranch
git add .
git commit -m "commit in new branch"
git push origin newBranch
compare&PullRequest
create pull request.
